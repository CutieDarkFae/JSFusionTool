Thou must in no wise let him approach too near unto thee, lest he do thee damage by his Noisome Breath. Wherefore the Magician must hold the Magical Ring near his face, and that will defend him. He giveth true answers of things Past, Present, and to Come, and can discover all Secrets. He will declare wittingly how the Spirits fell, if desired, and the reason of his own fall. He can make men wonderfully knowing in all Liberal Sciences. He ruleth 40 Legions of Spirits.

Some teachings even say that she is the source of all power in the universe, and is where Shiva gets his power, even going as far as to sometimes portray her as one-half of Shiva. She is widely worshiped by married women to ensure the health and longevity of their husbands. Parvati is the divine mother of the deities Ganesha and Kartikeya. Kali and Durga are considered to be her core aspects as produced by the Devi. Parvati first tried to meet Shiva by asking the god of love, Kamadeva, to shoot him with his arrows-of-desire thus disrupting his meditation so that Parvati could get his attention. Sadly the plan backfired, and as soon as Shiva was struck by the arrow he opened his third eye and annihilated Kamadeva in a rage. This act was catastrophic for mankind, as the world became barren and unregenerative. Eventually Shiva did fall in love with Parvati, and they were married, and by request of the other deities and the intercession of Parvati on Kamadeva's behalf, he was resurrected by Shiva, and the world flourished once again.","special":["This demon cannot be contracted."],"stats":{"Name":"Parvati","Alignment":"Chaos","Species":"Guardian","Race":"Earth Mother","Inheritance":"Curative","Growth":"Big Nauthiz","Level":"64","Force Slot":"8","HP":"616","Close Range":"46","MP":"302","Long Range":"63","Strength":"31","Spell":"72","Magic":"71","Support":"72","Vitality":"41","Phy.

The gods decided that they should repay her in some way, so they agreed to let her marry one of them, but she could only look at the feet of the gods when she chooses. She desired to marry the god Baldr, as he was the most handsome god in Asgard, and so she went for the most beautiful feet, assuming they could only belong to him. However she had actually picked the feet of the god of the wind and sea, Njord, whose feet were exceptionally clean due to the seawater. Secondly the gods agreed to make her laugh, which was a seemingly impossible task. This was not going well until Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a goat and the other end to his testicles. Loki and the goat began to pull each other back and forth while making loud squealing sounds, until Loki fell over into Skadi's lap, and she burst out laughing. As a final act of penance, Odin placed Thjazi's eyes into the night sky to shine as stars. Skadi and Njord had a good relationship, but they couldn't stand each other's living conditions (Njord liked the sea, while Skadi liked the icy mountains).

Setanta promises to come later, but the king forgets he had invited the boy, and Culann releases his guard dog into the garden to ward off intruders. Unaware of this, Setanta arrives at the party and is attacked by the dog, but chokes it to death. Seeing this, Culann the smith is beside himself with grief, but Setanta says to him, \"I shall become your guard dog.\" From that day forward, Setanta was known as \"Cú Chulainn\", (Hound of Culann).","special":["This demon cannot be contracted.","This demon is fusion-only."],"stats":{"Name":"Setanta / セタンタ","Alignment":"Neutral","Species":"Magica","Race":"Demigod","Inheritance":"Slash","Growth":"Small Tiwaz","Level":"28","Force Slot":"8","HP":"245","Close Range":"52","MP":"70","Long Range":"30","Strength":"38","Spell":"28","Magic":"13","Support":"32","Vitality":"34","Phy.

The main task of a valkyrie was to choose the most heroic of those that died in battle and carry them to Valhalla where they would become einherjar. As einherjar they would battle each other to the death, but be revived and healed at dusk where they could eat and drink to their hearts content. This is necessary as Odin needs strong and noble warriors for the battle at Ragnarok. In Valhalla the valkyries will also serve the food and drinks to the warriors.According to the Prose Edda, the valkyries not only decide who goes to Valhalla but during battle they allot death to men and choose who shall be the victor. They are often depicted as warrioresses on horseback where only their leader is given a name.Since the creation of Wagner's famous opera, The Twilight of the Gods, the story of the valkyrie Brunhilde has become well known throughout the world.","special":["This demon cannot be contracted.","This demon is fusion-only."],"stats":{"Name":"Valkyrie / ヴァルキリー","Alignment":"Neutral","Species":"Magica","Race":"Demigod","Inheritance":"Slash","Growth":"Hagalaz","Level":"36","Force Slot":"8","HP":"254","Close Range":"53","MP":"106","Long Range":"36","Strength":"36","Spell":"45","Magic":"33","Support":"40","Vitality":"23","Phy.

Kirin rarely become angry, but will strike down any who threaten or cause harm to nature and living things with bolts of purifying lightning.According to the Chinese Classic or Rites, the Feng Huang (Phoenix(, the Turtle, the Dragon, and the Kirin are tigether reffered to as the \"Four Symbols.\" This is why children who show exceptional talent at a young age are called \"Kirin children.\"The Kirin is sometimes counted among the Nine Children of the Dragon.","special":[],"stats":{"Name":"Kirin","Alignment":"Neutral","Species":"Beasts","Race":"Holy Beast","Inheritance":"Curative","Growth":"Eihwaz","Level":"41","Force Slot":"3","HP":"278","Close Range":"46","MP":"144","Long Range":"42","Strength":"28","Spell":"42","Magic":"34","Support":"49","Vitality":"24","Phy.

However he was outperfomed by means of a prayer. In more popular culture Efreets (better known as Ifrits) are powerful spirits that embody fire. They generally consider themselves superior to all other races because of their age and deeply resent that humans have found a way to mystically control them.

But when Shiva returned one day to find his path blocked by Ganesha, he cut the youth's head off, not knowing who he was. Seeing this, Parvati was stricken with grief, and Shiva, in panic, cut off the head of a passing elephant and placed it on Ganesha's shoulders. Ganesha was not happy with this, but came to accept it after being given a variety of powers.Each god in Indian mythology is said to have his or her own mount to ride, Ganesha's is a mouse.","special":[],"stats":{"Name":"Ganesha","Alignment":"Law","Species":"Magica","Race":"Yoma","Inheritance":"Slash","Growth":"Big Hagalaz","Level":"58","Force Slot":"5","HP":"556","Close Range":"72","MP":"234","Long Range":"36","Strength":"75","Spell":"66","Magic":"75","Support":"36","Vitality":"36","Phy.

Hesiod described one group of cyclopes and the epic poet Homer described another, though other accounts have also been written by the playwright Euripides, poet Theocritus and Roman epic poet Virgil. In Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus releases three Cyclopes, the sons of Uranus and Gaia, from the dark pit of Tartarus. They provide Zeus' thunderbolt, Hades' helmet of invisibility, and Poseidon's trident, and the gods use these weapons to defeat the Titans. In a famous episode of Homer's Odyssey, the hero Odysseus encounters the Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon and a nereid (Thoosa), who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant country. The connection between the two groups has been debated in antiquity and by modern scholars. It is upon Homer's account that Euripides and Virgil based their accounts of the mythical creatures.","special":["This demon cannot be contracted.","This demon is fusion-only."],"stats":{"Name":"Cyclops","Alignment":"Law","Species":"Demoniacs","Race":"Evil Demon","Inheritance":"Blunt","Growth":"Tiwaz","Level":"46","Force Slot":"7","HP":"458","Close Range":"68","MP":"94","Long Range":"24","Strength":"62","Spell":"21","Magic":"21","Support":"19","Vitality":"41","Phy.

In turn, Amaterasu became terrified of his wrath and retreated into a cave. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.The clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.Amaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.At that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance. The deities Ame-no-Koyane and Ame-no-Futodama then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine.

Like the N?gas, they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest devas.The exact size of the garuda is uncertain, but its wings are said to have a span of many miles. This may be a poetic exaggeration, but it is also said that when a garuda's wings flap, they create hurricane-like winds that darken the sky and blow down houses. A human being is so small compared to a garuda that a man can hide in the plumage of one without being noticed.

His wife is the golden haired Sif with whom he had one confirmed daughter, Thrud, and with his mistress Jarnsaxa he had two confirmed sons, Magni and Modi, although some source claim he had more children.During a plot by the frost giant Geirrod, Thor's brother Loki was forced to trick him into going to Geirrod's castle, where Geirrod planned to kill him. On their way to the castle they stopped by the dwelling of the giantess Grid. Grid, who was fond of Thor, warned him in secret of the sinister trap he was heading for, and gave him three sacred items; The war hammer Mjolnir, which when thrown at his enemies will return magically to his hand, and has the ability to produce fearsome lightning bolts. The belt Megingjord, which boosts the strength of its wearer ten-fold, allowing them to control Mjolnir. And finally the gloves Jarn Griepr, which allowed the wearer to lift Mjolnir. With all his new found power, Thor easily slew Geirrod, and then all other frost giants he could find. With his three new artifacts in hand, Thor became the most powerful god of the time.It is prophesied that at the time of Ragnarok, the Midgard Serpent, Jormungard, will raise from the sea and poison the sky. Thor and the serpent will do battle, and Thor will kill it, however once Thor has taken nine steps, he shall die from the effects of the serpent's poison.","special":["This demon cannot be obtained by any normal double-fusion.","This demon cannot be contracted.","This demon is fusion-only."],"stats":{"Name":"Thor","Alignment":"Law","Species":"Gods","Race":"Demon God","Inheritance":"Electric","Growth":"Master Tiwaz","Level":"76","Force Slot":"5","HP":"947","Close Range":"99","MP":"293","Long Range":"60","Strength":"112","Spell":"62","Magic":"58","Support":"52","Vitality":"86","Phy.

He was counted among the great solar deities who were the supreme keepers of law and order. In this way he was often paired with the asura Varuna where they were twinned as Mithra-Varuna.
